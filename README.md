## Raspberry Pi simple tri-colour LED tests

Just a few "Hello World" style LED tests, written in python. Controlling simple, non-controlled LED's using GPIO pins

### test.py
- Common ANODE LED's. Uses common 3v power hot from GPIO pin 1, and cathodes pulling down to pins 11, 13, and 15. 
- Very simple command interfact system, "red on", "red off" etc

Not much to it :) but it worked!
